        Hi there. This is where you would usually find your storage dashboard.
      </p>
      <p>
        Unfortunately, it looks like JavaScript is turned off in your browser,
        at least for this site. Please note that
        <a href="https://remotestorage.io/">remoteStorage</a> apps are usually
        written in JavaScript, so you will have to enable it for the vast
        majority of compatible Web apps.
